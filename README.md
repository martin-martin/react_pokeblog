# Pokéblog
I want to create something every day because it makes me happy and learn a lot.

I am building this blog to practice React and create a space where I can post (travel) stories, drawings, thoughts, experiences, and pictures related to Pokémon and Pokémon Go.

It will be live at [https://www.riverhike.com](https://www.riverhike.com)

Keep catching!
